# drf-best-practices
Demonstrates best practices for using DRF

# Takeaways circa April 13, 2023
- drf-spectacular has a lot of potential value for us and a fairly low cost to use.  We should formally adopt it as a best practice via an OEP.
- edx-rbac's `PermissionRequiredForListingMixin` is not meeting our needs - it's too complex and non-obvious.  We should create a decorator that can meet this need at the view function level.
- Viewsets and routing are sometimes fighting against us - we'd often be better off writing class-based views and explicitly declaring our routes one-by-one.  This will make the routes easier to discover and understand from a developer's perspective, and also make it easier to implement nested routes so we can be more obviously-RESTful.
- drf-simplejwt is a nice library and we should consider adopting it in Open edX (drf-jwt is not exactly actively maintained - the arch team is starting to look into this).
- drf-nested-routers are sort of ok, but maybe not worth the cost of adopting and fighting against yet-another-drf-author's opinions.  We can make our routes more explicit (as mentioned above) to get the same effect.
- Other DRF packages (e.g. drf-extensions, dynamic-rest, etc.) have their hearts in the right place, but seem to get further and further away from explicitness, which makes our systems harder and harder to comprehend.

# Tutorial getting started
Largely based off of https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/
Do as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser --email admin@example.com --username admin
python manage.py runserver
```
Now visit http://localhost:8000/api/v1/, click the "login" button at the top right,
use "admin/[your password]" to authenticate, and see all of the users at
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/

# Requests
## Making requests
- This is less about DRF, but if using the python `requests` library, add
the payload to your POST, PATCH, or PUT requests with `json={'your': 'data'}`

https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests

>If you need that header set and you donâ€™t want to encode the dict yourself, 
you can also pass it directly using the json parameter (added in version 2.4.2) and it will be encoded automatically:
```
url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
payload = {'some': 'data'}
r = requests.post(url, json=payload)
```
>Note, the json parameter is ignored if either data or files is passed.

## Parsing incoming requests:
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/requests/#request-parsing
- When getting data from the request body, always use `request.data`.
- When getting query parameters, always use `request.query_params`.

# Authentication
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#how-authentication-is-determined
>The authentication schemes are always defined as a list of classes. 
REST framework will attempt to authenticate with each class in the list, 
and will set `request.user` and `request.auth` using the return value of the first class that successfully authenticates.
If no class authenticates, `request.user` will be set to an instance of 
`django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser`, and `request.auth` will be set to None.

So you can think of authentication as a logical OR - if _any_ authentication class
succeeds, the request will be authenticated.

- edX tends to do a lot of authentication class declaration on our ViewSets, e.g.
`authentication_classes = [SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication]`.  But you can also set defaults
at the settings level:
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ]
}
```
- edX really likes JwtAuthentication, consider making that a default for your project.

# Routers

# ViewSets
- Many, smaller viewsets are preferrable to single, giant viewsets.
- It is ok to have viewsets that only support a single endpoint or action - this
can help you control things like permissions or serialization in a more granular way.
- Many, smaller files are preferrable to a giants `views.py` file.  There is nothing
magic about the name `views.py`.
- It's preferrable to decompose your views into read-only viewsets and viewsets
that add, modify, or delete records.  But then you have to route manually, which might be ok.

# Serializers
- Have different viewsets for reads and writes.
- DRF wants to serialize _objects_, not really _dicts_.
- You can serialize objects that are not models.
- Please for the love of all that is good and true, make your serializers
and their methods "small enough" - too much logic in the serializers is a code smell.
You can break down your giant serializer into smaller, more digestable serializers,
just as you can for Viewsets.

# Responses, exceptions, status codes

# Schema
- use drf-spectacular

# Thottling

# Pagination

# Authorization and edx-rbac
- In particular, list-level perms


# Using with Postman
Add a pre-request script to a collection:
```
// Refresh the OAuth token if necessary
var tokenDate = new Date(2010,1,1);
var tokenTimestamp = pm.environment.get("OAuth_Timestamp");
if(tokenTimestamp){
  tokenDate = Date.parse(tokenTimestamp);
}
var expiresInTime = pm.environment.get("ExpiresInTime");
if(!expiresInTime){
    expiresInTime = 300000; // Set default expiration time to 5 minutes
}
if((new Date() - tokenDate) >= expiresInTime) 
{
   pm.sendRequest({
      url:  pm.variables.get("Auth_Url"), 
      method: 'POST',
      header: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: {
          mode: 'raw',
          raw: JSON.stringify({
              'username': pm.variables.get("Auth_Username"),
              'password': pm.variables.get("Auth_Password"),
          }),
      },
  }, function (err, res) {
      console.log(err);
      console.log(res.json());
        pm.environment.set("OAuth_Token", res.json().access);
        pm.environment.set("OAuth_Timestamp", new Date());
        
        // Set the ExpiresInTime variable to the time given in the response if it exists
        if(res.json().expires_in){
            expiresInTime = res.json().expires_in * 1000;
        }
        pm.environment.set("ExpiresInTime", expiresInTime);
  });
}
```
Add (static) collection variables for
- Auth_Url: http://localhost:8000/api/token/
- Auth_Username: admin
- Auth_Password: [your-admin-password]

Add (dynamic) environment variables as below, they don't need values, the script
will populate them:
- OAuth_Timestamp
- ExpiresInTime
- OAuth_Token
