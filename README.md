# drf-best-practices
Demonstrates best practices for using DRF

# Tutorial getting started
Largely based off of https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/
Do as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser --email admin@example.com --username admin
python manage.py runserver
```
Now visit http://localhost:8000/api/v1/, click the "login" button at the top right,
use "admin/[your password]" to authenticate, and see all of the users at
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/

# Requests
## Making requests
- This is less about DRF, but if using the python `requests` library, add
the payload to your POST, PATCH, or PUT requests with `json={'your': 'data'}`

https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests

>If you need that header set and you donâ€™t want to encode the dict yourself, 
you can also pass it directly using the json parameter (added in version 2.4.2) and it will be encoded automatically:
```
url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
payload = {'some': 'data'}
r = requests.post(url, json=payload)
```
>Note, the json parameter is ignored if either data or files is passed.

## Parsing incoming requests:
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/requests/#request-parsing
- When getting data from the request body, always use `request.data`.
- When getting query parameters, always use `request.query_params`.

# Authentication
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#how-authentication-is-determined
>The authentication schemes are always defined as a list of classes. 
REST framework will attempt to authenticate with each class in the list, 
and will set `request.user` and `request.auth` using the return value of the first class that successfully authenticates.
If no class authenticates, `request.user` will be set to an instance of 
`django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser`, and `request.auth` will be set to None.

So you can think of authentication as a logical OR - if _any_ authentication class
succeeds, the request will be authenticated.

- edX tends to do a lot of authentication class declaration on our ViewSets, e.g.
`authentication_classes = [SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication]`.  But you can also set defaults
at the settings level:
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ]
}
```
- edX really likes JwtAuthentication, consider making that a default for your project.

# Routers

# ViewSets
- Many, smaller viewsets are preferrable to single, giant viewsets.
- It is ok to have viewsets that only support a single endpoint or action - this
can help you control things like permissions or serialization in a more granular way.
- Many, smaller files are preferrable to a giants `views.py` file.  There is nothing
magic about the name `views.py`.
- It's preferrable to decompose your views into read-only viewsets and viewsets
that add, modify, or delete records.

# Serializers
- Have different viewsets for reads and writes.
- DRF wants to serialize _objects_, not really _dicts_.
- You can serialize objects that are not models.
- Please for the love of all that is good and true, make your serializers
and their methods "small enough" - too much logic in the serializers is a code smell.
You can break down your giant serializer into smaller, more digestable serializers,
just as you can for Viewsets.

# Schema
- use drf-spectacular

# Thottling

# Pagination

# Authorization and edx-rbac
- In particular, list-level perms
