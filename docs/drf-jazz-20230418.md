# Some overview of DRF
...and some free-style jazz of my opinions/preferences that may eventually
drive us toward more DRF-related best practices.

# Cranky opinions

## The DRF docs
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/
The DRF docs are actually pretty great.  Start here.  Use the tutorial, even if
you think already know DRF (the tutorial humbled your esteemed author).

## drf-spectacular
https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
This has a lot of potential value for us and a fairly low cost to use.
We should formally adopt it as a best practice via an OEP.

From the drf-spectacular docs/authors:
>Most customization cases should be covered by the extend_schema decorator. We usually get pretty far with specifying OpenApiParameter and splitting request/response serializers, but the sky is the limit.

## Authentication
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#how-authentication-is-determined
>The authentication schemes are always defined as a list of classes. 
REST framework will attempt to authenticate with each class in the list, 
and will set `request.user` and `request.auth` using the return value of the first class that successfully authenticates.
If no class authenticates, `request.user` will be set to an instance of 
`django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser`, and `request.auth` will be set to None.

So you can think of authentication as a logical OR - if _any_ authentication class
succeeds, the request will be authenticated.

- edX tends to do a lot of authentication class declaration on our ViewSets, e.g.
`authentication_classes = [SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication]`.  But you can also set defaults
at the settings level:
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ]
}
```
**edX really likes JwtAuthentication, consider making that a default for your project.**

Also, see relevant bits in https://github.com/openedx/enterprise-access/pull/8
that map the JWT-defined user id to an `lms_user_id` field in the consuming application, i.e.
in the `EDX_DRF_EXTENSIONS.JWT_PAYLOAD_USER_ATTRIBUTE_MAPPING` key.

Also, drf-simplejwt is a nice library and we should
consider adopting it in Open edX (drf-jwt is not exactly actively maintained -
the arch team is starting to look into this).
https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Permissions/Authorization/edx-rbac
- IMHO, edx-rbac's `PermissionRequiredForListingMixin` is not meeting our needs - it's too complex and non-obvious.  We should create a decorator that can meet this need at the view function level.  I can say mean things about it, because I wrote it.

# ViewSets or class-based views
- Consider starting with class-based views via `generics.GenericAPIView`.
- Many, smaller viewsets are preferrable to single, giant viewsets.
- It is ok to have viewsets that only support a single endpoint or action - this
can help you control things like permissions or serialization in a more granular way.
- Many, smaller files are preferrable to a giants `views.py` file.  There is nothing
magic about the name `views.py`.
- From a permissions-viewpoint, it's preferrable to decompose your views into read-only viewsets and viewsets
that add, modify, or delete records.  But then you have to route manually, which might be ok.

## Routers
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/
- You don't technically need them, and they're really designed for use with `ViewSets`.
  Don't fight against them to get a  set of API routes that meets your needs - you can use `path()` for
  as fine-grained control as you need.
- We'd often be better off writing class-based views and explicitly declaring
  our routes one-by-one.  This would make the routes easier to
  discover and understand from a developer's perspective,
  and also make it easier to implement nested routes so we
  can be more obviously-RESTful.  It might also make permissioning more explicit.
- Pay attention to the `basename` argument, it can be simpler to understand the
  names of views if you set it explicitly.

## Serializers
- Consider different serializers for reads and writes.
- DRF wants to serialize _objects_, not really _dicts_. You can serialize objects that are not models.
- Please for the love of all that is good and true, make your serializers
and their methods "small enough" - too much logic in the serializers is a code smell.
You can break down your giant serializer into smaller, more digestable serializers,
just as you can for Viewsets.

## Filtering
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#generic-filtering
`django-filter` seems fine, you can do simple filtering on model field names
in a straightforward way, e.g.
```
filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]
filterset_fields = ['lms_user_id', 'content_key']
```

## Throttling/Rate-limiting
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling/
edX has a formal opinion on this: https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/docs/decisions/0009_simplify_ratelimiting.rst


## Other DRF third-party packages.
- drf-nested-routers are sort of ok, but maybe not worth the cost of adopting and fighting against yet-another-drf-author's opinions.  We can make our routes more explicit (as mentioned above) to get the same effect.
- https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  (not specific to DRF, but useful for exploring URL patterns).
- django debug toolbar is useful, particularly for exploring SQL that's executed when you visit a page in the browser.
- Other DRF packages (e.g. drf-extensions, dynamic-rest, etc.) have their hearts in the right place, but seem to get further and further away from explicitness, which makes our systems harder and harder to comprehend.

## Using some tools
### Django extensions
- `./manage.py show_urls --format table` is very useful for understanding the path **and view name** of all of the views in your project,
  which you'll often need when setting up unit tests.
- `./manage.py shell_plus` it auto-loads database models and subclasses of user-defined subclasses, super helpful.
- `python manage.py print_settings` does what you think it does
- `./manage.py list_model_info --model openedx_ledger.Transaction` super-useful for explaining model interfaces in installed packages.

### Postman
TODO, we could easily do a two-hour workshop on Postman.


# Questions from humans, and perhaps answers
- Why does the standard validator go check foreign keys by making an individual DB call per key.
  Which leads to why is validation vs your DB mixed in with serialization which should
  be just a wire format -> memory format concern and not go to any deeper levels.  (Thanks, Andy!)
  - Alex's answer: this might actually be about the HTML form for POSTing new data that you get on
  successful responses in the browser-level API. e.g. by hitting http://localhost:8000/api/v1/publications/1/articles/
  in your browser.
- [Django-related] Why can't I seem to get prefetch_related to work?
